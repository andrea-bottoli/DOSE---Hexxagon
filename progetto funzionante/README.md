Welcome to the src
==================

This folder contains the source code of all games, as well as the main UI.

* You can create subfolders (e.g. "logic", "gui") in the diretory of our group.

* IMPORTANT: the Eiffel compiler creates a folder "EIFGENs" when compiling. *NEVER* commit this folder to the repository. The folder is typically of large size and of no use to any other developer.

* You should update the entire "src" folder from time to time in order to make sure you can compile your code together with the code written by other groups.

* Have Fun!
